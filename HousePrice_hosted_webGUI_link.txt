⚙️ How It Works:
  1. model_building.ipynb trains Random Forest on house data
  2. Model is saved as house_price_model.pkl using joblib
  3. app.py loads the model and serves web interface
  4. Users input 6 features and get price predictions

🎓 For Exam Preparation:
  - Random Forest = Ensemble of decision trees
  - 6 Features: OverallQual, GrLivArea, TotalBsmtSF, GarageCars, YearBuilt, FullBath
  - Metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
  - Persistence: Joblib serializes models efficiently
  - Web Framework: Streamlit simplifies ML app deployment

================================================================================
FEATURES USED (WHY THESE 6?)
================================================================================

1. OverallQual (Overall Quality 1-10)
   → Strong predictor of price
   → Easy to understand
   
2. GrLivArea (Above Ground Living Area in sq ft)
   → Directly correlates with property value
   → Larger homes cost more
   
3. TotalBsmtSF (Total Basement Area in sq ft)
   → Basement space adds value
   → Minimal missing data
   
4. GarageCars (Number of cars garage holds)
   → Indicates property size and wealth
   → Proxy for overall home size
   
5. YearBuilt (Year house was built)
   → Age affects condition and value
   → Newer homes typically more expensive
   
6. FullBath (Number of full bathrooms)
   → Directly impacts comfort and value
   → Highly correlated with price

ALGORITHM: RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR
================================================================================

What is Random Forest?
  - Ensemble learning method
  - Combines multiple decision trees
  - Each tree votes on prediction
  - Final prediction = average of all trees

Why Random Forest?
  ✓ High accuracy
  ✓ Handles non-linear relationships
  ✓ Resistant to outliers
  ✓ No feature scaling required
  ✓ Provides feature importance
  ✓ Good generalization to unseen data

Hyperparameters Used:
  - n_estimators: 100 (number of trees)
  - max_depth: 20 (maximum tree depth)
  - min_samples_split: 5
  - min_samples_leaf: 2
  - random_state: 42 (for reproducibility)

================================================================================
MODEL PERFORMANCE METRICS (EXPLAINED FOR EXAM)
================================================================================

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - Average of absolute errors
  - Units: Same as target (dollars)
  - Formula: MAE = (1/n) * Σ|y_actual - y_predicted|
  - Interpretation: On average, predictions are off by X dollars

MSE (Mean Squared Error)
  - Average of squared errors
  - Penalizes large errors heavily
  - Formula: MSE = (1/n) * Σ(y_actual - y_predicted)²
  - Used to calculate RMSE

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - Square root of MSE
  - Units: Same as target (dollars)
  - Formula: RMSE = √MSE
  - Better than MSE for interpretation (same units)

R² (Coefficient of Determination)
  - Proportion of variance explained
  - Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
  - Formula: R² = 1 - (SS_residual / SS_total)
  - 0.85 R² = Model explains 85% of price variance

================================================================================
JOBLIB: MODEL PERSISTENCE METHOD
================================================================================

What is Joblib?
  - Python library for serializing objects
  - Optimized for NumPy arrays and scikit-learn models
  - Better than pickle for large objects
  - Saves as .pkl or .joblib files

Why Joblib over Pickle?
  ✓ Faster serialization
  ✓ Better compression
  ✓ More reliable for scikit-learn
  ✓ Handles NumPy arrays efficiently

How It Works in This Project:
  1. Training Phase: joblib.dump(model, 'house_price_model.pkl')
  2. Deployment Phase: loaded_model = joblib.load('house_price_model.pkl')
  3. Prediction: predictions = loaded_model.predict(new_data)

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Problem: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'joblib'"
Solution: pip install joblib

Problem: Model file not found
Solution: 
  1. Run model_building.ipynb completely
  2. Ensure house_price_model.pkl is in /model/ folder
  3. Restart Streamlit: streamlit run app.py

Problem: Prediction returns error
Solution:
  1. Check input ranges are within expected bounds
  2. Ensure all 6 features are provided
  3. Verify model file integrity

Problem: Deployment on Render fails
Solution:
  1. Check requirements.txt includes all dependencies
  2. Verify model file is in repository
  3. Check build logs on Render dashboard

EXAM CRAMMING NOTES (MEMORIZE THESE!)
================================================================================

Key Terms:
  ✓ Regression: Predicting continuous values (like prices)
  ✓ Classification: Predicting categories (like yes/no)
  ✓ Ensemble: Combining multiple models
  ✓ Feature: Input variable (X)
  ✓ Target: Output variable (y)
  ✓ Train/Test Split: 80/20 for evaluation
  ✓ Overfitting: Model memorizes training data (bad)
  ✓ Underfitting: Model too simple (bad)

Random Forest Facts:
  ✓ Ensemble of decision trees
  ✓ Handles non-linear relationships
  ✓ Feature importance = how much each input matters
  ✓ Voting mechanism for predictions
  ✓ Good for both regression and classification

Metrics to Know:
  ✓ MAE: Easy to interpret, same units as price
  ✓ RMSE: Most common metric for regression
  ✓ R²: Shows proportion of variance explained
  ✓ Training R² > Test R² = Overfitting

Model Persistence:
  ✓ Save trained model to disk
  ✓ Reload without retraining
  ✓ Joblib better than pickle
  ✓ Essential for deployment
